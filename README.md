### Hi there 👋

I'm Gavin (Guoli) Huang - but you can call me Gavin in English, or 黄国立 in Chinese.

- 🎓 **Studying**: Master of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide.
- 🔍 **Research**: I understand some of the machine learning processes in the classical medical domain, and am also now interested in the generative modeling family under the DDPM derivation, especially the cross-cutting research involving data augmentation for cross-domain downstream tasks.
- 📸 **Hobby**: I love photography! Capturing life one snapshot at a time.
- 📧 **Contact**: [cs.guoli.huang@gmail.com](mailto:cs.guoli.huang@gmail.com).
